        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Start by adding 1 cup of caster sugar to a heavy-bottomed pan over medium-low heat.
                Once the sugar has fully melted, add 1/2 cup of hot water to the pan and cook it well
                until all the sugar has melted and the caramel starts to thicken.
                Pour it over your cake mold, reserve.</li>
            <li>Once your caramel has cooled down a bit you can add your pineapple slices.</li>
            <li>Now add your softened butter to a bowl along with the remaining sugar, lemon zests
                and the vanilla extract. Mix it well until it becomes airy. Then proceede to add your eggs,
                one at a time.
            </li>
            <li>Mix the flour with the baking powder, and the ground spices.</li>
            <li>Now add both the flour mixture and the buttermilk to your butter-sugar mixture,
                in parts, alternating between the two.
            </li>
            <li>Slowly pour the batter into the mold and bake for 45 min at 180Â°C,
                or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only
                moist crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
