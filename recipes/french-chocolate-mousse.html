        <h2>A real chocolate mousse (no avocado!)</h2>

        <p><i><b>If you're anything like me you must be sick of seeing pseudo-healthy recipes
           posing as indulgent treats. My chocolate mousse recipe doesn't do any of that.
           Nope, it's not healthy, but you'll be too busy enjoying it to care!</b></i></p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>170 g good-quality dark chocolate (at least 60%)</li>
            <li>100 g butter</li>
            <li>4 large eggs - yolks and whites separated</li>
            <li>2/3 cup powdered sugar</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 tbsp water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>

        <ol> 
            <li>Chop the chocolate and butter in small pieces,
                add to a microwave-safe bowl and heat in 30-s intervals,
                until fully melted.
            </li>
            <li>In another bowl add the egg yolks, sugar, vanilla and water.
                Place it over a small saucepan with simmering water, being careful
                to not let the bottom of the bowl touch the water, 
                then whisk until the mixture turns pale. Add to the chocolate
                mix and whisk it to combine.
            </li>
            <li>Whip your egg whites until soft peaks are formed.</li>
            <li>Add a third of the egg whites to chocolate-yolk mix and
                fold it until well combined. Then proceed to add the remaining
                egg whites and mix it well. Finally pour the mixture into individual
                ramekins and refrigerate for at least 4h before serving.
            </li>
            <li>Dig in, you deserve it!</li>
        </ol>
